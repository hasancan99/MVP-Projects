The main code is in the PDEClass document. 

In this there are two classes. 

The small one at the bottom is a Phibuild class where 
the compositional order parameter (phi) is built in
matrix form with an input matrix size and a 
initial values(phi0) plus some random noise.

The larger class at the top is where most of the 
functions needed to complete the first half of the 
checkpoint are held. This class is simply called 
PDE.

The free energy is calculated in this class, along 
with matrix calculations for Phi and Chemical 
Potential. Plotting functions are in this class along
with an animation function. 

Data files for a run of 300K timesteps are in this
in this file and they initial parameters are given in
the main function. Both plots Phi0=0.0 and Phi0=0.5 
should be presenent in the file also.

This is not all of the checkpoint but it was all I 
was able to do given my circumstances.
